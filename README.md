# Breathe Project

This is the final team engineering project at Makers. We decided to create an iOS app that features an interactive map of various cities around the world that a user can navigate to and view a set of pollution data about the subareas within them. Our goal for this is to build an accessible app that helps an everyday user understand the environmental conditions of the area they're travelling through.

I would like an app that I can use on my smartphone.

As a concerned Londoner,
So that I can see the different levels of pollution in London,
I would like to be able to see a map of my city.

As a concerned Londoner,
So that I can identify areas of varying levels of pollution,
I would like to see the air quality displayed on the map.


As a concerned Londoner,
So that I can avoid areas of low air quality,
I would like to be able to see where I am on the map.
